# A — Potential to assist radiologists

1. Triage & prioritization

- Flag high-risk X-rays so urgent cases are read earlier (reduce time-to-diagnosis).
- Useful in high workload settings or EDs where rapid triage matters.

2. Second-reader / decision support

- Provide a second opinion (probability + heatmap) to increase radiologist sensitivity for subtle pneumonia.
- Helps less-experienced readers, e.g., in smaller hospitals or tele-radiology.

3. Quantification & monitoring

- Track lesion probability and heatmap changes across serial studies to help assess progression or response to treatment.

4. Workflow automation

- Auto-populate structured reporting fields (e.g., “probability of pneumonia: 0.87”) to reduce clerical load.

5. Data capture for research

- Automatically tag studies for cohort creation (for clinical studies or QA).

Limitations & realistic expectations

- Not a replacement for radiologist judgement — should be human-in-the-loop.
- Performance may degrade on images from unseen hospitals, different X-ray machines, or different patient populations.
- Susceptible to dataset bias (age, positioning, comorbidities, portable AP vs PA view).
- Explainability (Grad-CAM) helps but is not a proof of correctness.
