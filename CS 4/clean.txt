### Conclusions and Future Work

This project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning to predict hospital readmissions and length of stay. Along with this it explore the anomalies present. The model can serve as a valuable decision support tool for clinicians and hospital administrators. For clinical integration, key considerations include:

1.  Data Privacy: Strict adherence to regulations like HIPAA.

2.  Ethical Use: Ensuring the model is audited for bias and does not unfairly flag certain patient groups.

3.  Integration: The model must be seamlessly integrated into existing EHR systems without disrupting workflow.

4.  Patient Communication: Providing clear explanations to patients to ensure cooperation with post-discharge plans and avoid the stigma of being labeled as "high-risk."

### Future Work

The current project serves as a strong foundation, and several key areas can be explored to improve the model's performance, robustness, and clinical utility. Potential future work includes:

- Advanced Feature Engineering: Moving beyond the current dataset, we could engineer more complex features from detailed electronic health records (EHRs), such as specific medication dosages, full medical history, and clinical notes (using Natural Language Processing).

- Deep Learning Models: Investigating the use of deep neural networks, particularly for handling unstructured data like clinical notes or patient-generated data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) could be used to model sequences of patient visits over time.

- Advanced Anomaly Detection: Applying the anomaly detection models (One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest) to proactively flag unusual patient cases that may require closer review, such as patients with an atypical combination of diagnoses or an unusually high number of procedures.

- Hyperparameter Optimization: Implementing more rigorous hyperparameter tuning techniques (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization) to find the optimal settings for each model and further improve predictive performance.

- Dynamic Risk Prediction: Developing a model that provides a real-time risk score that changes throughout a patient's stay, allowing for more dynamic and timely interventions.

- Integration with Wearable Device Data: Exploring the potential of integrating data from patient wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches) to monitor activity levels, heart rate, and other health metrics after discharge. This could provide valuable post-hospitalization insights to predict and prevent readmission.
